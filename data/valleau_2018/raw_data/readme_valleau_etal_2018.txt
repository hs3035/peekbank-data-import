Carrier phrases: "The audio for noun trials consisted of simple carrier phrases (e.g., "Where is the cookie!"), whereas for verb trials, it varied by whether the depicted event involved one or two participants; one-participant events were queried with intransitive syntax (e.g., "Where is she clapping?"), and two-participant events were queried with transitive syntax (e.g., "Where is she bouncing the ball?"). The carrier frames varied in this way because we used what we thought was the most discourse-natural query for the different event types. For both event types, we also included queries in neutral syntax (e.g., "Find clapping!")."

Trial structure: still images (noun trials) or dynamic videos (verb trials) appeared on the screen during the Salience phase, then disappeared with a central fixation star and the test query (e.g., where is the ...); the images or videos reappeared during the Response phase

Timing of target word: between the Salience and Response phases (i.e., the query occurred once just before the onset of the Response phase; it occurred again partway through the Response phase)
